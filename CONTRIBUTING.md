## Bootleg 041 - Contributing to code

### Ideas and requests

Have an idea, something that could benefit Bootleg, or a feature request? Great! Create a new issue and make sure to state clearly what you have in mind.

### Putting your coding skills into Bootleg

If you have skills in Python and wish to help improve Bootleg, you can Fork the repository, do some changes and make a Pull Request.

### Help, feedback or chat

If you need help understanding the code (if you want to contribute), want to provide feedback or simply to chat, I am always online on IRC as Vgr in [#Bootleg_Dev on the EsperNet IRC network][0].
