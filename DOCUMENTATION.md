## Bootleg 041 Documentation

### Using the User Interface by Insight

You can use the Bootleg Configurator UI to pick your settings without needing to touch the code.

### Choosing your own default settings

You may pick your own settings in the `config.py` file (You need to rename it from `config.py.example` before). Those settings will get overridden by any preset setting you're loading.
