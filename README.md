## Bootleg

### Running the code yourself

1. You need Python 3.2 or higher
2. Copy or rename `config.py.example` to `config.py`
* If using the User Interface, that's all you need to do
* Else, edit `config.py` to fit your settings

### Presets

The User Interface can add, edit or remove any presets. If you wish to do so yourself, you can open a *.bp file with any text editor and change settings. If you forked the repository, the Bootleg Presets files are ignored, should you make any commit.
